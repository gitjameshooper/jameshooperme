    <p>My past work experience has involved building e-commerce sites and social media marketing visualizations. Specifically, I have tailored marketing campaigns for top-tier clients such as Aeropostale, Oakley, La Senza, MTV, Guess, IBM, &amp; MasterCard. These sites are all responsive built in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP using current web standards. I have also worked on a complete rebuild in Angular 2 and have a lot of experience using REST APIs</p>
